When rolling a job as long as you have a crystal and Run Type selected, a job will be selected and displayed.

Right clicking on the job display areas will allow you to manually select a job for that crystal.

Saving your current configuration will save your selected crystal, run type, modifier and jobs to a CSV. Saving or loading a configuration will cause that configuration to be loaded upon launching the application.

There is a built in timer so those who wish to time their runs do not have to use additional software. The timer is saved and loaded with your current configuration to allow for ease of starting and stopping runs. Text and background color, timer start/stop, and timer reset are editable. The keybinds for controlling the timer will work even when the tool is not selected.
